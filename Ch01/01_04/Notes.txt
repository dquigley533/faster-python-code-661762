SnakeViz binary doesn't seem to get added to path on MacOS?

Used:

python -m snakeviz prof.py

instead.

Current version of SnakeViz has a default view different to that in the video. Can be switched using the controls on the LHS.

In IPython/Jupyter:

%run -n thing.py
%prun -s <function_to_profile>
